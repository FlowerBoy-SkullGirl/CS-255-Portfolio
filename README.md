# CS-255-Portfolio
Work Performed in SNHU Course CS-255

```*Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
^What did you do particularly well?
&If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
$How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?```

*DriverPass is a fictional client that seeks to provide driving lesson services to students seeking to pass their DMV exams both online through quizzes and in person through training. The client requested a system that was capable of managing appointments, tracking student progress through courses, managing course content and material, and tracking updates from DMV regulations.
^In these design documents, a particularly good care is taken in ensuring a consistent, secure, and flexible design is created to ensure that the client's needs are served fully and that the implementation and execution of the design is carried out flawlessly.
&There is a complete lack of any code in these designs, and I am a programmer at heart before an architect. To resolve this issue, I would prefer to implement the system in its entirety.
$Every part of the system is correlated to the client's requested functionality, either directly as in the case of the appointment management subsytems, or indirectly as in the case of the security subsystem, which is required to keep all other functionalities working as intended. With this is mind, many of the functionalities performed by the system are from direct interaction with users that are either clients or employees of DriverPass. In both cases, the goal of software automation is to make these interactions as easy as possible for the human involved. The easier a client can make a reservation online, the more business opportunities DriverPass will have. The easier an employee can fulfill a job function, the more productive they can make their day.
#Designing software can be approached in many ways. In this class, we chose to describe in words how we would make a diagram IF we were to make a diagram describing a system. I found this impossible to do, so I simply made the diagrams first and THEN described them. I find pen and paper to be indispensible in design, and always prefer to work out logical connections between functionalities before any programming takes place.
